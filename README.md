# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying song genres using machine-learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to predict song genres accurately based on various audio features.

## Project Overview
The main objective is to explore and compare the performance of different machine learning models for song genre classification. The project includes:

Data Exploration: Analysis of audio features and their relevance to different genres.
Model Implementation: Employing various algorithms like Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, and KNN.
Data Balancing: Evaluation of models on both balanced and unbalanced datasets to prevent bias.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning models using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.
Cross Validation: Rigorous assessment of model performances across different datasets.

## Dependencies
Python 3.7+
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc. 

## Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/song-genre-classification.git
Install dependencies: pip install 
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for detailed analysis.

## Results and Findings
Model Performance: Details on model accuracies, F1-scores, and comparisons between balanced and unbalanced datasets.
Cross Validation Scores: Mean scores for each algorithm after cross-validation.

## Credits
This project was completed as part of the DSBA 6156 course at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

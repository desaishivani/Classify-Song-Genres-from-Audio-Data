# DSBA 6156 Final Project: Classify Song Genres from Audio Data  
**Team Members**: Shivani Desai, Yaxin Zhao, Viviana Montenegro Cortez, Robert Bintu  


## üìå **Project Overview**  
This project explores music genre classification using machine learning techniques to classify songs as either **Hip-Hop** or **Rock** based on their audio features. By automating genre classification, we eliminate manual errors and reduce processing time, enabling faster categorization for music streaming services and personalized recommendations.


## üéØ **Objective**  
- Analyze audio features such as `acousticness`, `danceability`, `tempo`, and more to predict song genres.  
- Apply machine learning models to understand and improve classification accuracy.  
- Balance the dataset to reduce bias towards the majority class (Rock).  
- Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.  


## üìÇ **Dataset**  
- **Source**: Datacamp, Echo Nest Dataset.  
- **Tracks**: 4,802 songs after preprocessing.  
- **Features**: 8 continuous audio features and a target variable (`genre_top`).  
- **Classes**:  
  - **Rock**: 3,892 tracks (majority class).  
  - **Hip-Hop**: 910 tracks (minority class).  


## üõ†Ô∏è **Methodology**  
### 1. **Data Preparation**  
- Cleaned and merged datasets to create `echo_tracks`.  
- Features scaled using **StandardScaler** to normalize values.  
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensions while retaining variance.  
- Balanced the dataset by downsampling the majority class (Rock).  

### 2. **Machine Learning Models**  
Implemented the following models for classification:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

### 3. **Evaluation**  
- Assessed models on both imbalanced and balanced datasets.  
- Tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** for optimal performance.  
- Used **cross-validation** to validate generalization performance.

## üí° **Insights**  
1. **Random Forest** consistently performed well across imbalanced and balanced datasets, achieving the highest accuracy (90.51% on imbalanced data).  
2. Balancing the dataset significantly improved the performance for the minority class (Hip-Hop).  
3. SVC and KNN demonstrated robust generalization, as reflected in their high cross-validation scores.  


## üîÆ **Future Work**
